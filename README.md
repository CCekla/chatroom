# Chatroom
## A family-chatroom app
---

This is an app I created for the course [Modern-js](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/) by __the-Net-Ninja__ on Udemy.
The node_modules folder is (obviously) left out, so it needs to be "npmd".
Also, you'll need to connect it to a Firestore db.
